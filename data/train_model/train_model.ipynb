Responsibilities then increased to include all departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful ATOs. Now, working on 4 new accreditation including re-authorization for an existing project. Succeeded in writing and implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited systems. Success of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in critical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise business model to understand the best fit for the program. The different projects required careful management of specific STIG compliance and hardening for the different configurations and services required for the specific domain to be integrated.

The next challenge came as storage requirements for better performance and more controlled uses. After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB. In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.
